# Jobiebot
This is a small Discord bot written in typescript using the Discord.js library and keeping persistent storage with a serverless cockroachdb instance queried with run-of-the-mill postgresql. I hope this can serve as a guide for others looking to build Discord bots and need a place to start. 

Some things in here will be less than optimal (like manually adding each command in the `/src/index.ts` file) but sometimes a task that can be done in 10 seconds doesn't need to be automated with horrible looking OS path code with joins and filename parsing, you know?

Anyways this is a reboot of my old bot, because I made that one a bit under four years ago and wanted to apply my new knowledge to it. 

If you're an interviewer or recruiter looking at this project as it's featured on my resume, hello! I look forward to connecting with you and hopefully get a chance to talk about this project in an interview.
